INTENDED MODE OF OPERATION

If you have a project that has all of its dependencies on Hackage, just do
$ hellno setup
in your project directory. Alternatively, when you have several projects that
can co-exist without breaking packages, you can just run
$ hellno path/to/1st/project.cabal path/to/another.cabal

If your project depends on local libs, you can use cabal-src-install. Make sure
it's in your PATH and run
$ hellno local-install
to install the necessary deps and cabal-src-install your packages.



Some of the known issues/limitations:
 - Non-existent handling of packages with several libraryDirs (do these exist
   anyway?)
 - Version tags not supported.
 - Error handling is bad.
 - Executables aren't handled at all.

TODO:
 - Parse .cabal files from the cabal-install cache to learn what executables
   belong to a package.
